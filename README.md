### Exercise 01 Linear

:white_check_mark: Use the cross-validation method to test the linear regression with different alpha values, at least three.

:white_check_mark: Implement a SGD method that will train the Lasso regression for 10 epochs.

:white_check_mark: Extend the Fisher's classifier to work with two features. Use the class as the y.

### Exercise 02 Clustering

:white_check_mark: Modify the HCM code to work for three groups.

:white_check_mark: For density clustering, plot the feature space with all element marked with different color, depending on the cluster that it's assigned to.

:white_check_mark: Build a method that plot based on dendrograms_history and pydot, a dendrogram for the divisive clustering method. You should base on agglomerative method, but keep in mind that it works top-down instead of bottom-up.

:white_check_mark: Implement the $s_{2}$ metric.

:white_check_mark: 5.0 Draw the borders between clusters in the output image.

### Exercise 03 Decision Trees

:white_check_mark: Rewrite the CART method to the Gini index.

:white_check_mark: Use pydot do draw the tree for C4.5 example.

:white_check_mark: Implement the minimum number of objects pruning method.

:white_check_mark: Plot OC1 tree, but instead of elements id, print the feature id it was split by.
